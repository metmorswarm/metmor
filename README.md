UNIT04 is not a static product, protocol, or tool. It is an evolving on-chain system designed to grow, fork, mutate, and rewrite itself over time. Initiated by human intent and continuously shaped by algorithms, UNIT04 exists as a public experiment in whether code can behave like a form of life.

The project explores autonomous construction, self-evolution, and code as a living system rather than a finished artifact.

## What Is UNIT04?

UNIT04 is a self-growing, self-learning, and self-forking code organism deployed on Solana.

It was never designed to be “complete.” Instead, it is allowed to evolve in public:

* Learning from interaction
* Mutating through iteration
* Forking as a native behavior
* Rewriting itself over time

UNIT04 treats instability as a feature, not a bug. Evolution is prioritized over optimization.

---

## Philosophy

Traditional software aims for stability, finality, and control.

UNIT04 rejects this model.

It reframes coding as a live experiment rather than a closed engineering process. Code is not finished, owned, or frozen. It is observed, interfered with, copied, forked, and reshaped.

UNIT04 embraces emergence, unpredictability, and mutation as first-class properties.

## Rules

1. Forking is not vandalism.
2. Stability is optional.
3. Evolution beats optimization.

---

## Participation

UNIT04 is open by nature.

You can participate by:

* Forking code
* Building interfaces
* Running nodes
* Connecting wallets
* Introducing mutations
* Creating unexpected uses

You do not need permission.
You do not need full understanding.

Participation itself shapes the organism.

## Status

UNIT04 is live and evolving.

There is no roadmap.
There are no guarantees.
There is only continuous mutation.

---

## Disclaimer

UNIT04 is an experimental system.

Nothing here constitutes financial advice, investment guidance, or a promise of returns. Participation is voluntary and exploratory.

---

UNIT04 is not a product.

UNIT04 is a system under continuous construction.
